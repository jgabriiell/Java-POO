# Object oriented programming
## Introduction
As the name suggests, it's a way to organize the system by objects. With OPP, we can represent real-world entities in a modular, reusable and maintable way. We are able to define the attributes of each objects and their behavior.
Object oriented programming follows the "Don't repeat yourself" (DRY) principle, which reinforces one of the goals to not repeat code unnecessarily. 

## Class
It's the set of data and behavior that we have in each object. It works like a blueprint of whatever we want to represent with our system. Inside the class is where we specify the attributes and what that entity does.
We can access its attributes and behavior by creating an instance of the class.

## Object 
It is what represents the real-life entity in the system. An object is what we can use to manipulate the data it contains. While the class only contains the definition of attribues (data) and behavior (methods),
the object performs the processing of the data to input a result or change the data. The object is an instance of the class.

# Core concepts of Object Oriented Programming
## Abstraction:
This priciple states that we have to focus only on necessary attributes of the object being implemented. Not every aspect of the entity should be specified inside the system, we want to simplify and 
not write unnecessary code.

## Ecapsulation:
It is the process of hiding data from the user. Ecapsulation helps us to prevent that sensitive data is exposed unnecessarily. We can achieve encapsulation by using keywords, such as 'Private' or 'Protected'
Ex.: private String name;

## Inheritance:
Inheritance is a way that we reuse the code in our system. This feature allow us to acquire attributes and methods from another class which allows to establish an hierarchical relationship beteween a Superclass and a Subclass.
